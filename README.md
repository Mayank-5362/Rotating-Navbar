Rotating Navbar
This project demonstrates a rotating navbar effect with a fixed circular container that houses two buttons for toggling navigation visibility. When the user clicks on the "open" button, the container rotates and reveals the navigation options. Clicking the "close" button reverses the rotation and hides the navigation.

Features :- 

Rotating circular button container.
Smooth animation transitions when opening and closing the navigation.
Navigation items slide into view from the left as the container rotates.
Responsive layout with smooth visual transitions for a better user experience.


Files
index.html: The main HTML structure of the page.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the page and animation effects.
script.js: JavaScript to handle the logic for toggling the navigation visibility.
